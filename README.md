# Drama LLM - Project Ollama

## Overview

Drama LLM - Project Ollama is a TypeScript and React-based application designed to interact with machine learning models for generating text-based responses. It provides a user-friendly interface for selecting different models and customizing parameters such as temperature, top-p, and top-k to fine-tune the generation process. Additionally, it allows users to define roles and input content for the models to process.

## Features

- **Model Selection**: Users can choose from a variety of pre-defined models to generate text.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Fine-tune the model's behavior by adjusting settings like temperature, top-p, and top-k.
- **Role-Based Interaction**: Define the role (system, user, assistant) for different types of interactions.
- **Responsive Design**: A user-friendly interface that adapts to various screen sizes.
